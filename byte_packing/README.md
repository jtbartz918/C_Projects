# Pack A Byte

Pack a byte is an example program for taking user input of 8 bits (0 or 1) and
packing it into a single byte. Depending on the byte it will display the default
case of converting the byte to hex, decimal and binary or the 2 special cases
of TURN_ON for all 1's or TURN_OFF for all 0's provided as input.

## Installation

You must have a C compiler installed. If you have gcc, use "gcc main.c" 
to compile an executable of "a.exe".
