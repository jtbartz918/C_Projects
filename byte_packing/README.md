# Pack A Byte

Pack a byte is an example program intended to be ran from a terminal.
This program takes user input of 8 bits (0 or 1) and packs it into a single
byte. Depending on the byte it will display the default case of converting the 
byte to hex, decimal and binary or the 2 special cases of TURN_ON for all 1's or 
TURN_OFF for all 0's provided as input. Inputs are intended to be '0' or '1'.
Those inputs will be respected, any other input will be treated as a '0'.

## Installation

You must have a C compiler installed. If you have gcc, use "gcc main.c" 
which will compile an "a.exe". To run in terminal type "/.a".
